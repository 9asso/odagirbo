# Odagirbo - Flutter Apps Repository

This repository contains Flutter apps generated by the APPSGEN platform and GitHub Actions workflows for building iOS and Android artifacts.

## Structure

```

│       ├── build-ios.yml       # iOS build workflow
│       └── build-android.yml   # Android build workflow

    ├── app-name-1/            # Auto-synced from APPSGEN backend
    ├── app-name-2/

```

## How It Works

1. Apps are created/updated in the APPSGEN platform
2. Backend automatically syncs apps to this repository
3. GitHub Actions workflows build iOS/Android artifacts
4. Download artifacts from the Actions tab

## Building Apps

### Manual Trigger

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **Build iOS App** or **Build Android App**
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Enter the app folder name (e.g., `frost-world-1766192023455`)
5. Download artifacts when build completes

### Automatic Trigger

Use the APPSGEN dashboard:
- Click ⋯ menu on any app
- Click "🚀 Build iOS (GitHub)" or "🚀 Build Android (GitHub)"
- Check Actions tab for progress

## Artifacts

- **iOS**: IPA files (unsigned, for testing)
- **Android**: APK files (for testing) + AAB files (for Play Store)
- **Retention**: 30 days
